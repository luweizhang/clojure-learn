`lein run` will run your project’s “main” function after making sure all the dependencies are up to date. <br>
`lein test` will run your project’s tests <br>
`lein uberjar` probably the least intuitive here, this command will bundle up your project and all its dependencies in a single executable jar, allowing your to run it with `java -jar` directly. <br>
